### Thermonuclear Burning on Rapidly Accreting Neutron Stars, Bildsten 1998
* Thermal stability and nuclear ignition depend on the accretion rate **per unit area**
    - Hence this defines **local** behavior on the neutron star and it can differ between spots on the star
    - ?Does this mean that if the accretion happens at different latitudes, due to different "rotational smearing" this can already change?
    - Magnetic fields can change the accretion location
* If the helium ignites before all the hydrogen has been burned, there will be more C to be used in the hydrogen-burning CNO cycle -> ?does that mean that the surface burning increases over time?
    - ?Can it even prevent bursts from happening at all, instead keeping a steady state of burning?
* ?**All** nuclear burning is thin shell burning, on the neutron star surface?
* The outcome of an unstable helium flash depends on the neutron star *radius* and *mass* - ?which might be linked in a general NS EoS?
    - **NOTE** find where this is mentioned again, end of Ch2, start of Ch3?
* In one dimension (?radial component?), the system will always evolve into a cycle, gathering fuel for a time before eventually a thermal instability is reached which can be observed
    - ?This one-dimensionality is about the spread of the fuel accros the NS, not the shape of the NS itself? Ch5 expands on this a bit
    - See **Table 1** for a detailed overview, on page 17
    - These conditions can be broken, see Ch3.3

### Black Holes, White Dwarfs, and Neutron stars, Shapiro Teukolsky

Chapter 2

* Global elements (large-scale) versus Local elements (small scale)
    - Global: gravity, electromagnetic fields, rotation etc
    - Local: pressure, viscosity, emissivity etc
* At high densities, inverse \beta-decay is the most important correction to the EoS
    - e + p -> n + \nu
    - Will assume that the neutrino's from this reaction escape the system
    - Reaction can proceed when e has enough energy (1.29MeV, mass diff between n and p, *c²)
* For densities above ~ 4e11 g/cm³ the n/p ratio becomes critical - any further increase in density will lead to *neutron drip*, which is a two-phase system where electrons, nuclei and **free neutrons** co-exist
    - The higher the density goes, the more free neutrons you get
    - Above 4e12 g/cm³, the neutrons add more pressure than the electrons. This medium, controlled by the neutron gas can be described as one large nucleus with a lower-than-normal nuclear density


Chapter 6

* Fluids recap, ?although it doesn't mention perturbations are only considered to first order?
* Stability criterium: E_2 = \delta²E = T_2 + V_2, where the sub_2 denotes variation of the second level, as the first level E_1 for the equilibrium energy is zero
    - T = kinetic energy of perturbation - can never be negative, per definition
    - V = potential energy of perturbation
    - If E_2 is **positive** for all initial data (\xi^i, d_t\xi^i) then V_2 will be positive and *thus the system will be stable*. On the other hand, if E_2 is **negative** for any (\xi^i, d_t\xi^i) then V_2 must be negative and there exists an instability
* Equivalent stability criteria are:
    - V_2 >= 0 for all perturbations
    - E_2 >= 0 for all perturbations
    - \omega² >= 0 for all modes
    - \bar\Gamma_1 >= 4/3 (radial stability only - its the pressure-averaged adiabatic index). \Gamma_1 = (\delta ln P) / (\delta ln \rho)
* General relativity tends to destabilize configurations, as gravity is stronger and thus collapse/instability comes easier
     - **Remember**; c = G = 1 for GR stuff
* GR can be used to rule out WD as pulsar candidates, since they cannot get below ~2s pulsation times and ms pulsars are known (p.161)
    - ?But why does it rule out slower pulsars, couldn't there be low mass low frequency pulsars that are actually WD?


Chapter 7

* 7.1 recaps the addition of magnetic fields into the fluid equations, useful background
* Difference between *secular* and *dynamic* instabilities in Maclaurin spheroids comes from dissipative terms - if a dissipative term is needed to cause the instability, it is called a *secular* instability. Otherwise it is a *dynamic* instability.
    - ?Still stable up to high eccentricities, so those instabilities should not impact me?
    - Dynamic instabilities grow on the dynamical timescale ~(G\rho)^-½
* Maclaurin spheroids beyond the bifurcation point (e>.81267) are secularly unstable to becoming **Jacobi** ellipsoids (*spinning footballs*) and **Dedekind** ellipsoids (*stationary footballs*, stationary shape but the ellipsoidal surface is maintained through the rotation of an inner fluid)
    - ?Do NS rotate uniformly? End of Ch7.3
