### Thermonuclear Burning on Rapidly Accreting Neutron Stars, Bildsten 1998
* Thermal stability and nuclear ignition depend on the accretion rate **per unit area**
    - Hence this defines **local** behavior on the neutron star and it can differ between spots on the star
    - ?Does this mean that if the accretion happens at different latitudes, due to different "rotational smearing" this can already change?
    - Magnetic fields can change the accretion location

* If the helium ignites before all the hydrogen has been burned, there will be more C to be used in the hydrogen-burning CNO cycle -> ?does that mean that the surface burning increases over time?
    - ?Can it even prevent bursts from happening at all, instead keeping a steady state of burning?

* ?**All** nuclear burning is thin shell burning, on the neutron star surface?

* The outcome of an unstable helium flash depends on the neutron star *radius* and *mass* - ?which might be linked in a general NS EoS?
    - **NOTE** find where this is mentioned again, end of Ch2, start of Ch3?

* In one dimension (?radial component?), the system will always evolve into a cycle, gathering fuel for a time before eventually a thermal instability is reached which can be observed
    - ?This one-dimensionality is about the spread of the fuel accros the NS, not the shape of the NS itself? Ch5 expands on this a bit
    - See **Table 1** for a detailed overview, on page 17
    - These conditions can be broken, see Ch3.3

### Black Holes, White Dwarfs, and Neutron stars, Shapiro Teukolsky

Chapter 2

* Global elements (large-scale) versus Local elements (small scale)
    - Global: gravity, electromagnetic fields, rotation etc
    - Local: pressure, viscosity, emissivity etc
* At high densities, inverse \beta-decay is the most important correction to the EoS
    - e + p -> n + \nu
    - Will assume that the neutrino's from this reaction escape the system
    - Reaction can proceed when e has enough energy (1.29MeV, mass diff between n and p, *c²)
* For densities above ~ 4e11 g/cm³ the n/p ratio becomes critical - any further increase in density will lead to *neutron drip*, which is a two-phase system where electrons, nuclei and **free neutrons** co-exist
    - The higher the density goes, the more free neutrons you get
    - Above 4e12 g/cm³, the neutrons add more pressure than the electrons. This medium, controlled by the neutron gas can be described as one large nucleus with a lower-than-normal nuclear density
