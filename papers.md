### Thermonuclear Burning on Rapidly Accreting Neutron Stars
* Thermal stability and nuclear ignition depend on the accretion rate **per unit area**
    - Hence this defines **local** behavior on the neutron star and it can differ between spots on the star
    - ?Does this mean that if the accretion happens at different latitudes, due to different "rotational smearing" this can already change?
    - Magnetic fields can change the accretion location

* If the helium ignites before all the hydrogen has been burned, there will be more C to be used in the hydrogen-burning CNO cycle -> ?does that mean that the surface burning increases over time?
    - ?Can it even prevent bursts from happening at all, instead keeping a steady state of burning?

* ?**All** nuclear burning is thin shell burning, on the neutron star surface?

* The outcome of an unstable helium flash depends on the neutron star *radius* and *mass* - ?which might be linked in a general NS EoS?
    - **NOTE** find where this is mentioned again, end of Ch2, start of Ch3?

* In one dimension (?radial component?), the system will always evolve into a cycle, gathering fuel for a time before eventually a thermal instability is reached which can be observed
    - ?This one-dimensionality is about the spread of the fuel accros the NS, not the shape of the NS itself? Ch5 expands on this a bit
    - See **Table 1** for a detailed overview, on page 17
    - These conditions can be broken, see Ch3.3
